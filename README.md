ðŸŽ¯ What is MoonCat Forum?
An online community forum where developersâ€”from beginners to seniorsâ€”gather to:

- Discuss coding, web development, and cybersecurity
- Share personal projects
- Ask for bugs/errors
- Help each other in learning modern technology

With a cat and moon-themed visual theme (MoonCat), this forum brings an atmosphere:

- Cozy ðŸ˜¸
- Cute but still productive âœ¨
- Friendly and open to all levels of developers

ðŸŒŸ Why the cat & moon theme?
- Cat = symbol of nocturnal developers (work at night, lazy during the day ðŸ˜¹)
- Moon = calm atmosphere, night time = most productive coding time
- The combination creates the atmosphere of a "comfortable night coding community"
